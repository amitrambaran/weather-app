# HaverMap Weather App
## How to use
1. Create a .txt file with a coordinate location in the format: latitude, longitude. Eg. 43.65748683,-79.37976122
2. Allow location access on your browser (Chrome doesn't support local web workers; bypass by hitting Win+R and entering  

 `chrome.exe --allow-file-access-from-files)`  
 
2. Drag it into the designated area, and observe as the map adds a pin on the visual map to the coordinate's location.
3. Information such as distance between your location and the dropped location will be available under the map. To set a new initial location, click anywhere on the map to place a pin.
